# GVine-Chat

How to run
->Clone the repo
->Go to the root folder
->Run npm install
->Then run cd ios 
->Then pod install && cd ..
->Then npx react-native run-android

To test the chat, run the code in 2 different devices/emulators and log in to 2 different IDs.

To Create a chat click the icon which is in bottom right corner, it will open the model that contains the list of all the users available.


PS: Since I had dependency issues with ruby I couldnt able to run the iOS part. I could have fixed that but if I did that means it will be tedious procuss     for me to run back my current office project.
